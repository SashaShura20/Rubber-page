A rubber layout was used to smoothly change the size and margins between breakpoints.:
* **Relative units of measurement:** Wide use of `%`, `vw`, `vh` for container and block widths.
* **Functions `calc()` and `min()':** For creating complex and flexible size calculations (for example, `calc(50% - 20px)').
*   **`flex-grow` / `flex-shrink`:** So that flex elements can dynamically fill the available space.
* **Rubber typography:** Using `clamp()` or a combination of `vw` + `@media' to smoothly change the font size.
